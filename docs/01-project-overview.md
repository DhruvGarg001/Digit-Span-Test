# Project Overview

## What is This Project?

The Digit Span Test is an online psychology experiment that measures working memory capacity. It's designed to test how many digits a person can hold and manipulate in their short-term memory.

## Purpose

This project was created as an educational demonstration for PSY 200 (Introduction to Psychology) Honors Option at Michigan State University. It allows students to:

1. Experience a classic psychological assessment firsthand
2. Understand how working memory is measured
3. See their own cognitive performance visualized with graphs
4. Learn about experimental design in psychology

## What Does It Test?

### Forward Digit Span
- Digits are shown one at a time on screen
- After all digits are shown, you type them back in the **same order**
- Example: See `3-7-9-2` → Type `3792`

### Backward Digit Span
- Digits are shown one at a time on screen
- After all digits are shown, you type them back in **reverse order**
- Example: See `3-7-9-2` → Type `2973`

## Key Features

### Progressive Difficulty
- Starts with 2 digits
- Goes up to 10 digits
- 2 trials at each length (for reliability)
- Total: 36 trials (18 forward + 18 backward)

### Detailed Results
- **Accuracy Graph**: Shows how many digits you placed correctly
- **Max Span Graph**: Shows the longest sequence you got completely correct
- **Trial Breakdown**: See every trial, your response, and what was correct
- **Statistics**: Success rate, total correct, accuracy percentage

### Privacy & Data
- No account required
- Only asks for University ID (stored locally)
- Nothing sent to servers
- Data stays on your computer

## Why This Matters

Working memory capacity is important for:
- **Learning**: Holding information while processing it
- **Problem Solving**: Keeping track of steps in complex tasks
- **Reading Comprehension**: Remembering earlier parts of sentences
- **Math**: Mental arithmetic and multi-step problems

## Educational Goals

Students completing this experiment will:
1. Understand how psychological tests are administered
2. Experience the cognitive demands of working memory tasks
3. Learn about forward vs backward span differences
4. See how data is collected and visualized in psychology research

## Target Audience

- Psychology students learning about cognitive testing
- Anyone interested in understanding their working memory capacity
- Educators teaching about memory and cognition
- Researchers looking for a simple digit span implementation
